# AWS LAMBDA FUNCTIONS S3 </br>

## Introduction </br>

Hey there ðŸ‘‹, This is a simple aws lambda function for adding files to s3 . In these directories you will find the code for the aws lambda function apis. These are basic functions to perform single actions on the dynamoDb database using lambda functions </br>
</br>

## Description </br>

This is a serverless web application that allows users to upload files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The application consists of an AWS Lambda function that handles file uploads, and a web interface built using ReactJS that allows users to select a file and initiate the upload process. </br>
</br>
The Lambda function is triggered by a pre-signed URL generated by the web interface using the AWS SDK for JavaScript. The function uses the pre-signed URL to authenticate the upload request and then uploads the file to the specified S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for Node.js. </br>
</br>
The web interface is built using ReactJS and uses Axios for making HTTP requests to the serverless API. Users can select a file using a file input, and then initiate the upload process by clicking a button. The interface displays a progress bar and a success message once the file has been uploaded. </br>
</br> </br>
To deploy the application, you'll need an AWS account with permissions to create and manage Lambda functions and S3 buckets. You'll also need to configure the web interface to use your AWS credentials and specify the S3 bucket where files should be uploaded. </br> </br>
</br>
This project can serve as a starting point for building serverless web applications that require file uploads.

# Installation Guide </br>

1 Make sure you have Node.js version 12 . You can check your Node.js version by running the command `node -v` in your terminal or command prompt. </br>
</br>
2- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to install the project. </br>
</br>
3- Clone the project repository using the Git command git clone <repository-url>, replacing <repository-url> with the URL of the project repository. </br>
</br>
4- Navigate to the project directory using the command cd <project-directory>, replacing <project-directory> with the name of the project directory that was created in step 3. </br>

5- Run the command `npm install` to install the project dependencies. </br>
</br>
6- Add any necessary secret keys and access keys to the project configuration files. For example, you may need to add AWS access keys to the config.json file or API keys to the constants.js file. </br>
</br>
7- Once the dependencies have finished installing, run the command `npm run offline` to start the project. This will start a local server running on your machine that you can use to test the project. </br>
</br>
8- By following these instructions, you should be able to install and run the project on your local machine. Please note that you may need to modify these instructions slightly depending on your specific operating system and environment. </br>
